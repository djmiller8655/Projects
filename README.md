# Projects
This is a directory to provide descriptions and direct viewers to the various projects that I have completed throughout my time at Penn State University.  

# Introduction
Hi, thank you for viewing my project github repository. For a quick introduction of myself, my name is Daniel Miller and I am currently a senior studying my Bachelors in Applied Data Science from The Pennsylvania State University. I have always been interesting in coding and data analysis since my time in high school where I spent an immense amount of time studying soccer and chess players statistics. 
During college I have spent time inside and outside of the classroom expanding my knowledge by completing projects pertaining to data management, data analysis, application development, statistical modeling, and machine learning. The tools that I have used throughout the projects include Python and R primarily, although I have used other programming languages during my previous work experiences (C++, C#). I have grouped the projects by domain, with additional information and screenshots included in the ReadMe files for the respective projects. Please feel free to reach out to me via email (djmiller8655@gmail.com) or by phone (908-619-4198) with any questions.

## Data Management
For the projects that I have completed relating to data management, I have primarily used relational databases through a combination of SQL and MySql. For modeling, I have experience in the use of both EER (Extended Entity Relationship) and UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the use of cardinalities to complete modeling prior to full implementations.
